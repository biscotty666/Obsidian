NOMA Method prompts:

- That reminds me...
- It's similar because...
- It's different because...

Example:
When I think of Carl Sagan, I think of [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (kit)]]. What Carl Sagan did for my love of the cosmos, [[Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (kit)]] did for my love of [[Flow]]. Both have enriched my life.
