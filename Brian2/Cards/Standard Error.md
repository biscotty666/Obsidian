## Standard Error

The Standard Error is an estimate of the standard deviation of a dataset, or the standard deviation of the sampling distribution.

The sampling distribution of the mean refers to the distribution of the means of repeated randomly generated samples. The sampling distribution itself has a mean and variance (SE). The larger the sample size the closer SE is to SD.

$$
SE_{mean}=\frac{standard\ deviation}{square\ root\ of\ sample\ size}
$$
The standard error on the mean is designated by $\sigma_{\hat{x}}$ or $s$.  So:

$$
\sigma_{\hat{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
