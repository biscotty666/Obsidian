## Standard Error

The standard error, aka Standard Error of the mean is the standard deviation of the means of multiple measurements.

1. Take multiple samples with the same number of measurements
2. Calculate the mean for each sample
3. Calculate the standard deviation of the means.

The standard error of the standard deviations is the standard deviation of the standard deviations.

The standard error can be calculated for any statistic that you calculate for multiple samples, eg. median, mode and percentiles.

The standard error is often calculated by [[Bootstrapping]].
