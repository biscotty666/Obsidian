## McDonalds Example

McDonald's has a recognition rate of 95%. In a group of 12 randomly selected adults, what are the mean an standard deviation?

$$
\begin{align}
\mu&=np=12\cdot0.95=11.4 \\
\sigma&=\sqrt{npq}=\sqrt{12\cdot0.95\cdot0.05}=0.755
\end{align}
$$

What are the minimum and maximum usual number of people who would recognize McDonald's?

$$
\mu+2\sigma=11.5+2(0.8)=13  \text{ people}
$$

$$
\mu-2\sigma=11.5-2(0.8)=9.8 \text{ people}
$$
