## Conditional Probability Examples

$$
\mbox{Pr}(A|B)=\frac{\mbox{Pr}(A\cap B)}{\mbox{Pr}(B)}
$$
### Student enrollment example

500 hundred students are at a certain school. 150 are enrolled in Algebra and 80 are enrolled in Chem class. 30 are taking both.

Given a random student
1. What is the probability that the student is taking Algebra?
2. Given the student is taking Algebra, what is the chance they are also taking Chem?
3. Given they are taking Chem, what is the probability they are taking Algebra?

1. 150/500=.3
2. $\frac{30}{500}$ / $\frac{80}{500}$ = $\frac{3}{8}$

### Zoo birds example

200 birds in a zoo. 70 are male with brown eyes and 100 are female with brown eyes. 20 are male with blue eyes and 10 are female with blue eyes.

1. Construct a contingency table
|        | Brown | Blue | Total |
| ------ | ----- | ---- | ----- |
| Male   | 70    | 20   | 90    |
| Female | 100   | 10   | 110   |
| Total  | 170   | 30   |200       |

For a random bird, what is the chance that?

1. Female 110/200 = 11/20
2. Male with brown eyes 70/200 = 7/20
3. Female given that it has brown eyes 100/170 = 10/17
4. Male given blue eyes 20/30 = 2/3
5. Blue eyes given that it is female 10/110
