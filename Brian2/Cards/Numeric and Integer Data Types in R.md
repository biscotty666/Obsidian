Numeric and Integer Data Types in R

Numbers in [[R]] are assigned a numeric data type by default even if they are whole numbers. They can be converted to numeric with the `as.integer()` function. 

Integers can be declared as such by appending an `L` after the number or variable. I'm a little unclear on how this works. #question/R
