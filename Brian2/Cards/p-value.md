## p-value

- Used to compare, for example, 2 drugs to see if there is a difference in effectiveness between them.
- The null hypothesis is that the drugs are the same. The p-value measures our confidence that the null hypothesis should be rejected.
- In general, a p-value $<0.05$ is desired.
- A small p-value does not indicated the degree of difference between the two drugs.
- There are two types of p-values: One-sided and Two-sided. One-sided are rarely used.
