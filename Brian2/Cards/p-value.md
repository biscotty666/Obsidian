## p-value

- Used to determine whether one set of data is significantly different from another.
- The null hypothesis is that they are the same. 
- The p-value measures our confidence that the null hypothesis should be rejected.
- In general, a p-value $<0.05$ is desired.
- A small p-value does not indicated the _degree_ of difference. 
- There are two types of p-values: One-sided and Two-sided. One-sided are rarely used.
