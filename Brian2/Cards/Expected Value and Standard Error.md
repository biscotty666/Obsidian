## Expected Value and Standard Error

The mean of [[Random variables]] is called the __expected value__. The standard deviation is called the __standard error__.

The expected value is denoted $E[X]$  where $X$ is a random variable.

The sampling distribution of the mean refers to the distribution of the means of repeated randomly generated samples ([[Random variables]]). The sampling distribution itself has a mean and variance (SE). The larger the sample size the closer SE is to SD.

$$
SE_{mean}=\frac{standard\ deviation}{square\ root\ of\ sample\ size}
$$
The standard error on the mean is designated by $\sigma_{\hat{x}}$ or $s$.  So:

$$
\sigma_{\hat{x}}=\frac{\sigma}{\sqrt{n}}
$$
