## Sampling models

Many real-life situations can be modeled as _draws from an urn_.

- Polling for elections could be draws from an urn where 0 is Republican and 1 is Democrat
- Epidemiological studies can use a random sample from an urn containing outcomes for the population of interest
- Casino gambling is a common use-case
