## Bootstrapping

A process often used to calculate the [[Standard Error]] from a set of data.

1. Take 5 random measurements from the data
2. Calculate the mean/median/mode on the sample
3. Continue until you have many means/medians/etc.
4. Calculate the standard deviation of the means/medians/etc.
5. This is the standard error
