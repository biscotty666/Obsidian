## Multiplication Rule

Used to determine the probability of multiple events occurring. This represents a logical `AND`. For a logical `OR` use the [[Addition Rule]]

For 2 events:
$$
\mbox{Pr}(A \mbox{ and } B) = \mbox{Pr}(A)\mbox{Pr}(B \mid A)
$$

For multiple events:

$$
\mbox{Pr}(A \mbox{ and } B \mbox{ and } C) = \mbox{Pr}(A)\mbox{Pr}(B \mid A)\mbox{Pr}(C \mid A \mbox{ and } B)
$$

For multiple events under independence. Data should be checked to ensure actual independence of events.

$$
\mbox{Pr}(A \mbox{ and } B \mbox{ and } C) = \mbox{Pr}(A)\mbox{Pr}(B)\mbox{Pr}(C)
$$
