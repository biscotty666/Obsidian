## Life Insurance Example


- $1M policy
- $500/year premium
- Term 20 years

What is the maximum probability of dying in 20 years?

Calculate how much they gain over the life of the policy and divide by the payout:
$$
\frac{$500\times 20}{$1,000,000}=\frac{$1}{$100}
$$
If the company insured 100 people the company would receive $100 in premium. They can break even if only 1 person dies.

$$
P(\text{Sal dies in 20 years})\le\frac{1}{100}
$$
