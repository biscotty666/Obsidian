## Error Bars

There are three common error bars.

1. The [[Standard Deviation]]  quantifies the variation within a set of measurements. It tells you how the _data_ is distributed around the mean.

2. The [[Standard Error]] quantifies the variation in the means from multiple sets of measurements and tells you how the _mean_ is distributed.

- The standard error can be estimated from a single set of measurements
- Even with a single set of measurements you may be given the option to plot the standard error

3. [[Confidence Intervals]]  are related to Standard Error.
