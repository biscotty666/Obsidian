## Law of Averages aka Law of Large Numbers

As the number of draws grows large and approaches the size of the urn, the standard error tends toward 0 and the average tends toward the average of the urn.

The law of averages applies only when the number of draws is very large and not in small samples. For example, a coin flip which resulted in heads 10 times would be predictive of the probability of the next coin. But after $10^6$ tosses then the mean would be almost 50%.
