**Personal knowledge management** (**PKM**) is a process of collecting information that a person uses to gather, classify, store, search, retrieve and share [knowledge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") in their daily activities ([Grundspenkis 2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFGrundspenkis2007)) and the way in which these processes support work activities ([Wright 2005](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFWright2005)). It is a response to the idea that [knowledge workers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_worker "Knowledge worker") need to be responsible for their own growth and learning ([Smedley 2009](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFSmedley2009)). It is a bottom-up approach to [knowledge management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knowledge_management "Knowledge management") (KM) ([Pollard 2008](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management#CITEREFPollard2008)).
