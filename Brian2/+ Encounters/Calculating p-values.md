## Calculating p-values

The p-value consists of 3 parts:
1. The probability that random chance would result in the observation, plus
2. The probability that something equally rare could be observed, plus
3. The probability that something equally rare would be observed.

If a coin is flipped twice, the probability of the possible outcomes are HT/TH=0.5, 2H=0.25, 2T=0.25. So the p-value for 2H would be 0.25 (probability of random chance)+0.25 (2T is equally unlikely)+0 (There is nothing more unlikely) for a total of 0.5. So there is no reason to suspect that the coin is not a normal coin.
