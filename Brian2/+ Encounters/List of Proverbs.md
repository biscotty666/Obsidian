Appear weak when you are strong.
Opportunities multiply as they are siezed.
Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.

Choose a job you love, and you will never have to work a day in your life.
Knowledge without practice is useless. Practice without knowledge is dangerous.
