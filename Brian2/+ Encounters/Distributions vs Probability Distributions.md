## Distributions vs Probability Distributions

The distribution function of a [[Random variables]] $X$ is a __theoretical__ function $F(a)$ which answers the question: what is the probability that $X\le a$.

The probability distribution of $X$ is based on the actual values of $X$, and the mean of $X$ is the __expected value__ while the standard deviation is the __standard error__.

A sufficient number of draws with a [[Monte Carlo Simulation]] would closely approximate the probability distribution of $X$.
