### Progress and Reflection

I started creating the  [[Obsidian and PKM Training Class]]. I decided to use [Canvas](https://obsidian.md/canvas) to design and outline the course. The canvas so far is [[Obsidian and PKM Class Overview.canvas]], and I also started [[What is Obsidian?.canvas]] Got very focused and didn't get back to [[Data Camp Module 3]] yet.

Tomorrow we shall see.
