### Progress

Cleaning out the upstairs closet was big. Funny it started with ironing üòÜ. I'm motivated to do the other closet tomorrow. Didn't cut down the elm, but so what.

### Reflections

I feel lighter and lighter. It was funny that I wanted to take a shorter ride today and ended up doing the longest so far. It felt really good to just keep going. Just keep going seems to be my motto these days. #ideas/me
