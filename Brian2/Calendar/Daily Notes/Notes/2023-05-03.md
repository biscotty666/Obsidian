### Progress

I made reasonable progress on all things Obsidian. I didn't acheive any of my goals, though I'm not done for the night,

### Reflections

I'm torn between my two priorities. Today I completely ignored the priorities I set and didn't do anything with DS. What to do now? I'm finishing the wrap-up now before I actually wrap-up, because otherwise I don't do it.
