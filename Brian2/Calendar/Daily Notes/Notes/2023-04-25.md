[Laptop Log:: System upgrade]  [Laptop Date:: 2023-04-25]. [Laptop Comments:: System upgrade included an upgrade of R. When I closed and re-opened R Studio I found I needed to re-install libraries in R which took a long time (> 10 mins). I 💗R. All the package upgrades went smoothly and I was prompted to do any installs necessary.]


### Reflections
