### Progress

Ten bars left to memorize in Bach's 1st invention.

Finished Chapter 10 notes. Not much, really. Chapter 11 looks a little more in depth.

Mermaid looks really nice. Maybe better than canvas for simple flow charts. I need to figure out canvas/mermaid for the presentations. I need to explore embedding them in slides.
