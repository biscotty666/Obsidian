### Progress

A lot of progress in understanding various distributions and their characteristics

Went through quite a few StatQuest videos, some with lots of math.

Verified that I understand the process of calculating Maximum Likelihood.

### Today

- [x] Statquest, statquest ⏫ ➕ 2023-04-27 🛫 2023-04-27
- [x] Do more velocity work ⏫ 🛫 2023-04-27
- [x] Run through Back at least once 🔼 🛫 2023-04-27 ✅ 2023-04-27
- [x] Talk to Eric ⏳ 2023-04-29 ✅ 2023-05-08

### Logs

#### Study Log

Made a lot of notes on StatQuest videos.

Learned about Maximum Likelihood and Standard Error.

#### Output Log

Create something

#### Piano Log

Velocity practice Mozart [Piano Log:: Velocity practice Mozart]  [Piano Time:: 25]

#### Exercise Log

Walked to the river [Exercise Route:: River]  [Exercise Time:: 30]  [Exercise Type:: Walk] [Exercise Note:: not much water left in the ditch.]

#### Domestic Log

Nothing really


### Reflections

As usual, I enjoyed the math today. I'm definitely getting more comfortable with the whole sh'bang.

### Tasks

##### Overdue

```tasks
not done
due before today
```


##### Due today

```tasks
not done
due today
status.type is not IN_PROGRESS
```

##### High and medium priority

```tasks
not done
(priority is high) OR (priority is medium)
sort by priority
```

##### In Progress

```tasks
status.type is IN_PROGRESS
```

##### Others


```tasks
not done
(priority is not high) AND (priority is not medium) AND (is not recurring)
sort by priority
```
