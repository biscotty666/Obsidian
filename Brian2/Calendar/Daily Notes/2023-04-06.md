### Progress

Finished notes for Chapter 9. I got back to the book after a couple of days hiatus in Obsidian and SvelteKit. I'm really enjoying the SvelteKit class and hope that I can use it for some [[Data Visualization]] project soon. It's so delightful.

I set up daily goals, and have been meeting them today (yay 💥)
