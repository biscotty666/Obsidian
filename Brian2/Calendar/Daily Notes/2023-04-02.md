### Goals 

- [x] Finish yesterday's note ✅ 2023-04-03

This was a big communications day for me starting at 3:00 with inLang to discuss Localization and Internationalization. They are a young company looking to offer plug-in localization services. I've been in conversation with them over email and discord for several days and they invited me to attend.

I spent a lot of time with Eric walking through [[Obsidian]] and my set-up, showing off some features. 

I started working on material for an [[Obsidian and PKM Training Class]]. I need to investigate the [[Obsidian Slides Plugin]] and [[Excalidraw]] soon.

Finally I started working on making atomic notes for the [[Introduction to Data Science]] sections I've already gone through.
