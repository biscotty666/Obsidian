### Progress

I never made it back to my Data Science course but I'm really enjoying the [[SvelteKit Course]]. About half-way through now. Every time I work with Svelte I wonder why anyone would use anything else

It's reliance on basics like file names, directory trees and url strings is fantastic. KISS, unixy, everything.

I've made progress on Bach's first invention. I think I'm appreciating it in ways I didn't when I was young. I pecked my way through No. 2 and I'm having trouble getting the feel of it.
