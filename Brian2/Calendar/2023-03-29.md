> As a technology, the book is like a hammer. That is to say, it is perfect: a tool ideally suited to its task. Hammers can be tweaked and varied but will never go obsolete. Even when builders pound nails by the thousand with pneumatic nail guns, every household needs a hammer.

### Progress

I spent most of my time learning [[Obsidian]]. I mainly wanted to learn as much as I could about how to best store my notes, which folders to use and the various default views, especially the [[Inbox]], [[Outbox]] and [[Notebox]]. I cleaned out all of the LYT notes that I didn't wan't and linked the rest into my MOCs. 

I would like to make a training on [[Syncthing]] and [[Obsidian]]/[[Zettelkasten]]. Maybe I could offer a [[PKM]] course for students at CNM. #idea #note/developüçÉ [[Obsidian and PKM Training Class]]. 

I need to take more time tomorrow for organizing my thoughts...maybe. otoh I think I was pretty productive and focused on the most important thing: developing my brain on a solid foundation to create a good workflow.

Tomorrow I'd like to explore canvas and the [[ExcaliBrain]] module for mind-mapping
