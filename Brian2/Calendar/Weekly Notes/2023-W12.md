## Reflections

Early in the week I focused on my [[R]]  and [[Data Science]] work. I finished [Part 1](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.1x+3T2022/home) and [Part 2](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:HarvardX+PH125.2x+3T2022/home) of the [[PH125 Introduction to Data Science]]  I'm taking. I finished the 13th chapter of [[Introduction to Data Science]].

Late in the week I discovered [[Obsidian]] and have spent a lot of time with it.
