# Reflections

I struggled a lot with the Bach. I feel like it is in part a lack of confidence. I don't understand why I can play perfectly well a few times, then when I go back later I forget some basic fingerings. I guess it's normal, just curious I guess. In my mind there's always a voice saying "are you going to get the next bit" or remember it or whatever. __I'm so glad to have rediscovered the metronome__ #ideas/insights

Obsidian continues to fascinate me, and I spent a lot of time on it this week. I had a lot of fun with the visual design bits, and the idea of using it for teaching really took off today. I love the structural aspect as well. #ideas/teaching #ideas/visual #ideas/structure

I ended up taking pretty much a whole day off to work on gardening and installing Fedora 39. It was overall a great experience. Maybe I should have a day off every day. Remember serendipity. #ideas/philosophy #ideas/planning
